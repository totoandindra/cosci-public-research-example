# Experiment Plan

## Research Question
*What specific question does this experiment aim to answer? Be precise and measurable.*

[State your research question here. Example: "Does applying technique X improve performance metric Y by at least Z% compared to baseline method B?"]

## Background & Motivation
*Why is this experiment important? What gap in knowledge does it address?*

[Explain the context and significance. Reference relevant prior work from the literature review.]

## Hypothesis
*What is your testable prediction?*

**Primary Hypothesis:** [State your main hypothesis clearly. Example: "We hypothesize that method X will outperform baseline Y by 15% on metric Z."]

**Secondary Hypotheses (if any):**
- [Additional hypothesis 1]
- [Additional hypothesis 2]

## Experimental Design

### Variables
- **Independent Variable(s):** [What you're manipulating]
- **Dependent Variable(s):** [What you're measuring]
- **Control Variables:** [What you're keeping constant]
- **Confounding Factors:** [Potential issues to watch for]

### Methodology
1. **Baseline Setup:** [Describe the baseline/control condition]
2. **Treatment Conditions:** [Describe experimental conditions]
3. **Data Collection:** [How will data be gathered?]
4. **Sample Size:** [Number of trials/samples and justification]

## Evaluation Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Metric 1:** [Name, formula, interpretation]
- **Metric 2:** [Name, formula, interpretation]

### Secondary Metrics
- [Additional metrics for deeper analysis]

### Statistical Tests
- **Test 1:** [e.g., t-test, ANOVA, etc.] for [purpose]
- **Significance Level:** Î± = 0.05
- **Power Analysis:** [Sample size justification]

## Implementation Milestones

### Phase 1: Setup (Days 1-2)
- [ ] Load and preprocess datasets
- [ ] Implement baseline method
- [ ] Verify baseline reproduction

### Phase 2: Development (Days 3-5)
- [ ] Implement proposed method
- [ ] Unit testing and validation
- [ ] Parameter tuning

### Phase 3: Evaluation (Days 6-7)
- [ ] Run full experiments
- [ ] Collect all metrics
- [ ] Statistical analysis
- [ ] Generate visualizations

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Success
- Baseline reproduced within 5% of reported results
- Proposed method runs without errors
- Results are statistically significant (p < 0.05)

### Target Success
- Improvement of 10-15% over baseline
- Consistent results across multiple runs
- Clear interpretable patterns

### Stretch Goals
- Improvement of >20% over baseline
- Novel insights about why method works
- Generalization to additional datasets

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|--------------------|
| Baseline not reproducible | Medium | High | Have backup baseline from literature |
| Insufficient compute | Low | Medium | Use smaller dataset subset initially |
| Method doesn't converge | Medium | High | Implement early stopping, adjust hyperparameters |

## Resources Required

### Computational
- **Hardware:** [GPU/CPU requirements]
- **Estimated Runtime:** [Hours/days]
- **Storage:** [GB needed]

### Data
- **Primary Dataset:** [Name, size, location]
- **Secondary Dataset:** [If applicable]

### Dependencies
- **Frameworks:** [TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.]
- **Key Libraries:** [List main dependencies]

## Timeline

| Day | Task | Deliverable |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 1 | Setup environment, load data | Preprocessing pipeline |
| 2 | Implement baseline | Baseline results |
| 3-4 | Implement proposed method | Working implementation |
| 5 | Parameter tuning | Optimal hyperparameters |
| 6 | Full evaluation | Raw results |
| 7 | Analysis and visualization | Final report |
