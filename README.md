# cosci-public-research-example

A demonstration repository showcasing best practices for computational science research project organization, documentation, and reproducibility.

This research project was created with [Co-Sci](https://co-sci.org)

## Project Structure

- `paper_drafts/` - Draft versions of research papers
- `grant_proposals/` - Grant proposal documents  
- `paper_template/` - LaTeX template files for academic papers
- `hypothesis.jsonl` - Tracked assumptions and hypotheses
- `paper.jsonl` - Literature review papers and references
- `proposal.jsonl` - Experiment proposals and evaluation plans
- `run.jsonl` - Experiment runs and execution tracking
- `analysis.jsonl` - Experiment analyses and findings
- `experiments/` - Organized experiment folders
  - Each experiment contains: `plan.md`, `result.md`, `run/`, `analysis/`
- `related_work/` - Literature review notes and paper summaries
- `section_notes/` - Working notes for paper sections
  - `01-research-concept-direction.md` - Research concept and hypotheses
  - `02-lit-review.md` - Literature review notes
  - `03-experiment-ideas.md` - Experiment proposals
  - `04-datasets.md` - Dataset documentation
  - `05-experiment-runs.md` - Experiment execution logs
  - `06-experiment-analyses.md` - Analysis and findings
- `data/` - Research data (max 2GB per file, use Git LFS for larger)
- `notes/` - Informal notes, thoughts, and documentation
  - `meeting_notes/` - Meeting notes and collaborative discussions
  - `code/` - Code snippets, scripts, and development notes
- `.github/workflows/` - Automated workflows including Claude AI assistant
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI research assistant instructions

## Getting Started

1. Start by documenting your assumption and hypothesis in `hypothesis.jsonl`
2. Add papers to `paper.jsonl` and conduct literature review in `related_work/`
3. Propose experiments in `proposal.jsonl`
4. Execute experiments and track in `run.jsonl`
5. Analyze results in `analysis.jsonl`
6. Draft your paper in `paper_drafts/`

## Research Methodology

This project follows standard scientific research methodology. See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed guidance.
